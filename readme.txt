Taggy pings the OMDb API to quickly suggest and autofill tags that don't yet exist.

== Description ==

Taggy allows you to search an open API of ALL Movie and Videogame Titles to quickly and accurately insert them as new tags within the Wordpress Tags Taxonomy.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `taggy` folder to your `~/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Usage ==

To use the plugin, activate it and then visit the 'Taggy Settings' page. Enter an OMDb API Key. Save the key and search any Movie or Videogame Title when adding or editing a post to get a list of suggestions. Click a suggestion to add the new tag.
